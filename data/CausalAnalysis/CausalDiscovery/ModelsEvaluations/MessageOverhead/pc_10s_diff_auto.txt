Evaluated the performance of the causal mechanisms and the invertibility assumption of the causal mechanisms and the overall average KL divergence between generated and observed distribution and the graph structure. The results are as follows:

==== Evaluation of Causal Mechanisms ====
The used evaluation metrics are:
- KL divergence (only for root-nodes): Evaluates the divergence between the generated and the observed distribution.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluates the average squared differences between the observed values and the conditional expectation of the causal mechanisms.
- Normalized MSE (NMSE): The MSE normalized by the standard deviation for better comparison.
- R2 coefficient: Indicates how much variance is explained by the conditional expectations of the mechanisms. Note, however, that this can be misleading for nonlinear relationships.
- F1 score (only for categorical non-root nodes): The harmonic mean of the precision and recall indicating the goodness of the underlying classifier model.
- (normalized) Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS): The CRPS generalizes the Mean Absolute Percentage Error to probabilistic predictions. This gives insights into the accuracy and calibration of the causal mechanisms.
NOTE: Every metric focuses on different aspects and they might not consistently indicate a good or bad performance.
We will mostly utilize the CRPS for comparing and interpreting the performance of the mechanisms, since this captures the most important properties for the causal model.

==== Evaluation of Invertible Functional Causal Model Assumption ====

--- The model assumption for node messageReceived is rejected with a p-value of 0.006094711037588851 (after potential adjustment) and a significance level of 0.05.
This implies that the model assumption might not be valid. This is, the relationship cannot be represent with this type of mechanism or there is a hidden confounder between the node and its parents.

--- The model assumption for node graft is rejected with a p-value of 0.0 (after potential adjustment) and a significance level of 0.05.
This implies that the model assumption might not be valid. This is, the relationship cannot be represent with this type of mechanism or there is a hidden confounder between the node and its parents.

--- The model assumption for node prune is rejected with a p-value of 0.0 (after potential adjustment) and a significance level of 0.05.
This implies that the model assumption might not be valid. This is, the relationship cannot be represent with this type of mechanism or there is a hidden confounder between the node and its parents.

--- The model assumption for node messageOverhead is not rejected with a p-value of 1.0 (after potential adjustment) and a significance level of 0.05.
This implies that the model assumption might be valid.

Note that these results are based on statistical independence tests, and the fact that the assumption was not rejected does not necessarily imply that it is correct. There is just no evidence against it.

==== Evaluation of Generated Distribution ====

==== NOTE ====
Always double check the made model assumptions with respect to the graph structure and choice of causal mechanisms.
All these evaluations give some insight into the goodness of the causal model, but should not be overinterpreted, since some causal relationships can be intrinsically hard to model. Furthermore, many algorithms are fairly robust against misspecifications or poor performances of causal mechanisms.
